# fizzbuzz-template
This project is one of a series that explores a couple of Dependency Injection solutions. It uses the Famous [FizzBuzz Kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz) to demonstrate the different approaches.

This particular project demonstrates an alterative to Dependency Injection: we can decompose this kind of tasks with the Template Pattern too.
